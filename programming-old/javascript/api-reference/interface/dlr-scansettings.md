### intervalTime?: *number*

> Scan interval used to allow the library to release the CPU periodically. Measured in ms. Must be a positive value ( > 0 ).

### duplicateForgetTime?: *number*

> Ignore duplicated results found in the specified time period. Measured in ms.

### whenToPlaySoundforSuccessfulRead?: *string*

> Sets when to play sound on barcode recognition (user input is required on iOS or [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes#chrome_enterprise_policies) for any sound to play). Allowed values are
>
> * `never` : never play sound, the default value;
> * `frame` : play sound when one or multiple barcodes are found on a frame;
> * `unique` : play sound when a unique/unduplicated barcode is found (if multiple unique barcodes are found on the same frame, play only once).

### soundOnSuccessfullRead?: *string*

> Specifies the sound to play on barcode recognition. If not specified, the default one is used.

### whenToVibrateforSuccessfulRead?: *string*

> Sets when to vibrate on barcode recognition (user input is required in [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes#chrome_enterprise_policies) for the vibration). It only supports Android Devices with a vibrating system. Allowed values are
>
> * `never`: never vibrate, the default value;
> * `frame`: vibrate when one or multiple barcodes are found on a frame;
> * `unique`: vibrate when a unique/unduplicated barcode is found (if multiple unique barcodes are found on the same frame, vibrate only once).

### vibrateDuration?: *number*

> Returns or sets how long the vibration lasts in milliseconds. It only supports Android Devices with a vibrating system. The default value is `300` .
>
>```js
>let scanSettings = await scanner.getScanSettings();
>scanSettings.intervalTime = 100; // 100ms
>scanSettings.whenToPlaySoundforSuccessfulRead = "never";
>scanSettings.whenToVibrateforSuccessfulRead = "never";
>scanSettings.duplicateForgetTime = 3000; // 3s
>await scanner.updateScanSettings(scanSettings);
>```

### captureAndRecognizeInParallel?: *boolean*

> Returns or sets whether to capture the next frame while the previous frame is being decoded to save time. The default value is `true`.
